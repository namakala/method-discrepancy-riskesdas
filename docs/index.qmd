# Executive Summary {-}

- SKI 2023 and Riskesdas 2018 pose major result differences, as suggested by @tbl-diff
- Shown in @fig-dot and @tbl-trend, the disease prevalence trends between Indonesia and Global are rather similar
- Comparing @tbl-diff and @tbl-trend, we see that from 2018 to 2023 the trend in the national survey report does not follow GBD data
- This difference might occur due to methodological difference between SKI 2023 and Riskesdas 2018
- @tbl-best-fit summarized the best fitting model to forecast the GBD time-series
- @fig-dot-aug projected the forecast from 2020 to 2023, assuming that no major changes occur in Indonesia or globally

Action plan:

1. Fit the national survey report differences into model forecast
1. Evaluate two scenarios:
   1. Projection from GBD data
   1. Projection from national survey report
1. Assess the mean percentage differences between two scenarios
