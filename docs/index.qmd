# Executive Summary {-}

- Data storytelling:
  - SKI 2023 and Riskesdas 2018 pose major result differences, as suggested by @tbl-diff
  - Shown in @fig-dot-aug, the disease prevalence trends between Indonesia and Global are rather similar
  - Interpreting @fig-scenario, we see that from 2018 to 2023 the trend in the national survey report does not follow GBD data
  - This difference might occur due to methodological difference between SKI 2023 and Riskesdas 2018
- Include in report:
